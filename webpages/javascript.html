        JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.

        JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.

        JavaScript is easy to learn.

        You don't have to get or download JavaScript.

        JavaScript is already running in your browser on your computer, on your tablet, and on your smart-phone.

        JavaScript is free to use for everyone.
        JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.

        JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.
        In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between &lt;script&gt; and &lt;/script&gt; tags.
        JavaScript Functions and Events
        A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for.

        For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button.
        <br>
        JavaScript Display Possibilities:-
        <br>
        JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:
        <br>
        <br>Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.<br>
        Writing into the HTML output using document.write().<br>
        Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().<br>
        Writing into the browser console, using console.log().<br>
        JavaScript Print:-
        JavaScript does not have any print object or print methods.

        You cannot access output devices from JavaScript.

        The only exception is that you can call the window.print() method in the browser to print the content of the
        current window.
