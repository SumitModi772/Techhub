        It indicates the purpose of the program. It is represented as
        /*……………………………..*/
        Preprocessor Directive:
        *Under revision

        #include&lt;stdio.h&gt; tells the compiler to include information about the standard
        input/output library. It is also used in symbolic constant such as #define PI
        3.14(value). The stdio.h (standard input output header file) contains definition
        &declaration of system defined function such as printf( ), scanf( ), pow( ) etc.
        Generally printf() function used to display and scanf() function used to read value.
        <br>
        Global Declaration:-
        This is the section where variable are declared globally so that it can be access by
        all the functions used in the program. And it is generally declared outside the
        function :
        main()
        It is the user defined function and every function has one main() function from
        where actually program is started and it is encloses within the pair of curly braces.
        The main( ) function can be anywhere in the program but in general practice it is
        placed in the first position.
        <br>
        <br>
        Identifiers
        Identifiers are user defined word used to name of entities like variables, arrays,
        functions, structures etc. Rules for naming identifiers are:
        1. name should only consists of alphabets (both upper and lower case), digits
        and underscore (_) sign.<br>
        2. first characters should be alphabet or underscore<br>
        3. name should not be a keyword<br>
        4. since C is a case sensitive, the upper case and lower case considered
        differently, for example code, Code, CODE etc. are different identifiers.<br>
        5. identifiers are generally given in some meaningful name such as value,
        net_salary, age, data etc. An identifier name may be long, some implementation
        recognizes only first eight characters, most recognize 31 characters. ANSI
        standard compiler recognize 31 characters. Some invalid identifiers are 5cb, int,
        res#, avg no etc<br>
        <br>
        There are certain words reserved for doing specific task, these words
        are known as reserved word or keywords. These words are predefined and always
        written in lower case or small letter. These keywords cann’t be used as a variable
        name as it assigned with fixed meaning. Some examples are int, short, signed,
        unsigned, default, volatile, float, long, double, break, continue, typedef, static,
        do, for, union, return, while, do, extern, register, enum, case, goto, struct,
        char, auto, const etc.
        <br>
        data types<br>
        Data types refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of
        different types before its use. The type of a variable determines how much space it
        occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted. The value of a
        variable can be changed any time.
        C has the following 4 types of data types<br>
        basic built-in data types: int, float, double, char<br>
        Enumeration data type: enum<br>
        Derived data type: pointer, array, structure, union<br>
        Void data type: void<br>
        A variable declared to be of type int can be used to contain integral values
        only—that is, values that do not contain decimal places. A variable declared to be
        of type float can be used for storing floating- point numbers (values containing
        decimal places). The double type is the same as type float, only with roughly twice
        the precision. The char data type can be used to store a single character, such as the
        letter a, the digit character 6, or a semicolon similarly A variable declared char can
        only store character type value.<br>
        There are two types of type qualifier in c<br>
        Size qualifier: short, long<br>
        Sign qualifier: signed, unsigned<br>


        Constant is a any value that cannot be changed during program execution. In C,
        any number, single character, or character string is known as a constant. A constant
        is an entity that doesn’t change whereas a variable is an entity that may change
        <br>
        Variables:-
        Variable is a data name which is used to store some data value or symbolic names
        for storing program
        computations and results. The value of the variable can be change during the
        execution. The rule for naming the variables is same as the naming identifier.
        Before used in the program it must be declared. Declaration of variables specify its
        name, data types and range of the value that variables can store depends upon its
        data types.
        <br>
        Loops in C<br>
        <br>
        Loop:-it is a block of statement that performs set of instructions. In loops
        Repeating particular portion of the program either a specified number of time or
        until a particular no of condition is being satisfied.
        There are three types of loops in c<br>
        1.While loop<br>
        2.do while loop<br>
        3.for loop<br>

        if statement<br><br>
        Statement execute set of command like when condition is true and its syntax is<br>
        If (condition)<br><br>
        Statement;<br>
        The statement is executed only when condition is true. If the if statement body is
        consists of several statement then better to use pair of curly braces.

        if…..else ... Statement<br><br>
        it is bidirectional conditional control statement that contains one condition & two
        possible action. Condition may be true or false, where non-zero value regarded as
        true & zero value regarded as false. If condition are satisfy true, then a single or
        block of statement executed otherwise another single or block of statement is
        executed.
        <br><br>
        Array is the collection of similar data types or collection of similar entity stored in
        contiguous memory location. Array of character is a string. Each data item of an
        array is called an element. And each element is unique and located in separated
        memory location. Each of elements of an array share a variable but each element
        having different index no. known as subscript.
        <br><br>
        Two dimensional array is known as matrix. The array declaration in both the array
        i.e.in single dimensional array single subscript is used and in two dimensional
        array two subscripts are is used.
        <br>
        String<br>
        Array of character is called a string. It is always terminated by the NULL
        character. String is a one dimensional array of character.
        We can initialize the string as<br>
        char name[]={‘j’,’o’,’h’,’n’,’\o’};
        <br>
        A function is a self contained block of codes or sub programs with a set of
        statements that perform some specific task or coherent task when it is called.
        It is something like to hiring a person to do some specific task like, every six
        months servicing a bike and hand over to it.
        Any ‘C’ program contain at least one function i.e main().
        There are basically two types of function those are
        1. Library function
        2. User defined function
        The user defined functions defined by the user according to its requirement
        System defined function can’t be modified, it can only read and can be used.
        These function are supplied with every C compiler
        Source of these library function are pre complied and only object code get used by
        the user by linking to the code by linker.
       
        <br>
        Local variable:-
        variables that are defined with in a body of function or block. The local
        variables can be used only in that function or block in which they are declared.
        <br>
        Global variable:-<br>
        the variables that are defined outside of the function is called global variable. All
        functions in the program can access and modify global variables. Global variables
        are automatically initialized at the time of initialization.
        <br>
        Static variables:- static variables are declared by writing the key word static.
        <br>
        <br>
        Recursion
        <br>
        When function calls itself (inside function body) again and again then it is
        called as recursive function. In recursion calling function and called function are
        same. It is powerful technique of writing complicated algorithm in easiest way.
        According to recursion problem is defined in term of itself. Here statement with in
        body of the function calls the same function and same times it is called as circular
        definition. In other words recursion is the process of defining something in form of
        itself.
