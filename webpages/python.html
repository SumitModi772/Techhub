        Python is a popular programming language.

        Python can be used on a server to create web applications.

        It is widely used general purpose,high level programming
        language.Developed by Guido van Rossum in 1991.
        It is used for:<br>
        software development,
        web development (server-side),
        system scripting,
        Mathematics.
        <br>
        Features of Python:- <br>
        1. Easy to use – Due to simple syntax rule<br>
        2. Interpreted language – Code execution &
        interpretation line by line<br>
        3. Cross-platform language – It can run on
        windows,linux,macinetosh etc. equally<br>
        4. Expressive language – Less code to be written
        as it itself express the purpose of the code.<br>
        5. Completeness – Support wide rage of library<br>
        6. Free & Open Source – Can be downloaded
        freely and source code can be modify for improvement<br>

        How to work in Python:-
        (i) in Interactive mode
        * Search the python.exe file in the drive in
        which it is installed.
        If found double click it to start python in
        interactive mode<br>
        (ii) in Script mode
        Step 1 (Create program file)
        Below steps are for simple hello world program
        a. Click Start button-&gt;All Programs -&gt;
        Python &lt;version&gt;-&gt;IDLE
        b. Now click File-&gt;New in IDLE Python Shell
        Now type
        print “hello”
        print “world”
        print “python is”,”object oriented programming lang.”
        c. Click File-&gt;Save and then save the file with
        filename and .py extension
        <br>
        Step 2 (Run program file)
        a. Click Open command from IDLE’s File menu and
        select the file you have already saved
        b. Click Run-&gt; Run Module
        c. It will execute all the commands of program file
        and display output in separate python shell
        window<br>
        Note :- Python comes in 2 flavours – python 2.x and python 3.x . Later
        one is Backward incompatible language as decide by Python Software
        foundation(PSF). Mean code written in 2.x will not execute on 3.x . Visit
        the below link for difference between 2.x & 3.x
        <br>
        Data Handling:-<br>
        Most of the computer programming language
        support data type, variables,operator and expression
        like fundamentals.Python also support these.<br>

        Data Types:-
        Data Type specifies which type of value a variable can
        store. type() function is used to determine a variable's
        type in Python.
        <br>
        Data Types In Python<br>
        1. Number<br>
        2. String<br>
        3. Boolean<br>
        4. List<br>
        5. Tuple<br>
        6. Set<br>
        7. Dictionary<br>

        1. Number In Python:-
        It is used to store numeric values
        Python has three numeric types:-
        1. Integers
        2. Floating point numbers
        3. Complex numbers.
        <br>
        2. String In Python:-
        A string is a sequence of characters. In python we can create string
        using single (' ') or double quotes (" ").Both are same in python.
        <br>
        3. Boolean In Python:-
        It is used to store two possible values either true or false.<br>
        4.List In Python:-
        List are collections of items and each item has its own index value.
        <br>
        5. Tuple In Python:-
        List and tuple, both are same except ,a list is mutable python objects and
        tuple is immutable Python objects. Immutable Python objects mean you
        cannot modify the contents of a tuple once it is assigned.<br>
        6. Set In Python:-
        It is an unordered collection of unique and
        immutable (which cannot be modified)items.
        <br>
        7. Dictionary In Python:-
        It is an unordered collection of items and each
        item consist of a key and a value.<br>

        Expression<br>
        It is a valid combination of operators,literals and variable.<br>
        1. Arithmatic expression :- e.g. c=a+b<br>
        2. Relational expression :- e.g. x>y<br>
        3. Logical expression :- a or b<br>
        4. String expression :- c=“comp”+”sc”<br>

        The process of converting the value of one data type (integer, string, float, etc.) to
        another data type is called type conversion.<br>
        Python has two types of type conversion.<br>
        Implicit Type Conversion<br>
        Explicit Type Conversion<br>
        Implicit Type Conversion:-
        In Implicit type conversion, Python automatically converts one data type to another
        data type. This process doesn't need any user involvement.<br>
        Explicit Type Conversion:-
        In Explicit Type Conversion, users convert the data type of an object to
        required data type. We use the predefined functions like int(),float(),str() etc.
        <br>
        Control Statements<br>
        <br>
        Control statements are used to control the flow
        of execution depending upon the specified
        condition/logic.<br>
        There are three types of control statements.<br>
        1. Decision Making Statements<br>
        2. Iteration Statements (Loops)<br>
        3. Jump Statements (break, continue, pass)<br>

        Decision Making Statement:- Decision making statement used to control the
        flow of execution of program depending upon
        condition.
        There are three types of decision making statement.<br>
        1. if statements:- if statements
        An if statement is a programming conditional
        statement that, if proved true, performs a
        function or displays information.<br>
        2. if-else statements:- if-else Statements
        If-else statement executes some code if the test expression is true
        (nonzero) and some other code if the test expression is false.<br>
        3. Nested if-else statements:- Nested if-else statement
        The nested if...else statement allows you to check for multiple test
        expressions and execute different codes for more than two
        conditions.<br>
        Iteration Statements (Loops)<br><br>
        Iteration statements(loop) are used to execute a block
        of statements as long as the condition is true.
        Loops statements are used when we need to run same
        code again and again.
        Python Iteration (Loops) statements are of three type :-<br>
        1. While Loop<br>
        2. For Loop<br>
        3. Nested For Loops<br>
        1. While Loop:-
        It is used to execute a block of statement as long as a
        given condition is true. And when the condition become
        false, the control will come out of the loop. The
        condition is checked every time at the beginning of the
        loop.<br>
        2. For Loop:-
        It is used to iterate over items of any sequence, such
        as a list or a string.<br><br>
        range() Function Parameters<br>
        start: Starting number of the sequence.<br>
        stop: Generate numbers up to, but not including this number.<br>
        step(Optional): Determines the increment between each numbers
        in the sequence.<br>
        3. Jump Statements:-
        Jump statements are used to transfer
        the program's control from one location to another.
        Means these are used to alter the flow of a loop like - to
        skip a part of a loop or terminate a loop
        There are three types of jump statements used in
        python.<br>
        1.break<br>
        2.continue<br>
        3.pass<br>
        MATH MODULE<br>
        It is a standard module in Python. To use mathematical functions of this
        module,we have to import the module using import math.
