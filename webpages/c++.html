        C++ is a popular programming language.

        C++ is used to create computer programs, and is one of the most used language in game development.

        C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax.
        Why Use C++
        C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.

        C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.

        C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be
        reused, lowering development costs.

        C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
        C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

        C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.

        C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.

        The language was updated 5 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2023 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, and
        C++23.

        C++ is fun and easy to learn!

        As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.
        <br>
        Difference between C and C++<br>
        C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax.

        The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ supports classes and objects, while C does not.<br>
        C++ Get Started<br>
        To start using C++, you need two things:<br>

        1.A text editor, like Notepad, to write C++ code<br>
        2.A compiler, like GCC, to translate the C++ code into a language that the computer will understand.
